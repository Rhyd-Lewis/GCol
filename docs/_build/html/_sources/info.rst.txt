General Info
============

GCol currently requires Python 3.7 or above. It also requires an istallation of NetworkX (ideally version 3.4 or above). To install the GCol library from the Python Package Index (`PyPi <https://pypi.org/>`_), run the following command from a command prompt::

    $ python pip install gcol

The algorithms and techniques used in this library are based on the 2021 textbook by Lewis, R. M. R. (2021) `A Guide to Graph Colouring: Algorithms and Applications <https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-81054-2>`_, Springer Cham. (2nd Edition). In bibtex, this book can be cited as:: 

	@book{10.1007/978-3-030-81054-2,
	  author = {Lewis, R. M. R.},
	  title = {A Guide to Graph Colouring: Algorithms and Applications},
	  year = {2021},
	  isbn = {978-3-030-81056-6},
	  publisher = {Springer Cham},
	  edition = {2nd}
	}

To start using this library, you might find it helpful to look at this :doc:`demonstration <demo/Demo>`, which gives step-by-step instructions and sample code. You may also want to consult the user guide of `NetworkX <https://networkx.org/>`_, because GCol makes use of its data structures and functionality.
