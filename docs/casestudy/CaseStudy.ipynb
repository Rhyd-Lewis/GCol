    "# Case Study: Exam Timetabling\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we consider a practical case study concerning the use of graph coloring methods in the production of exam timetables at a university. This will help to showcase the various tools available in the ``gcol`` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, a college needs to produce an exam timetable for its students. The aim is to assign each exam to a \"timeslot\" while trying to avoid \"clashes\". (A clash occurs when there are one or more students who need to attend a pair of exams, but these exams have been assigned to the same timeslot and therefore occur at the same time.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is specified using an $n\\times n$ symmetrical matrix $X$, where $n$ is the number of exams to schedule. An element $X_{ij}$ in this matrix gives the number of students who need to sit both exams $i$ and $j$. Also, an element $X_{ii}$ gives the total number of students sitting exam $i$. For example, in the following matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "9 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 6 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 9 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "1 & 0 & 0 & 3 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 8 & 0 & 0 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 4 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "6 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 9 & 2 \\\\\n",
    "0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 3 & 0 & 2 & 8\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "-  There are $n=8$ exams (labelled 0 to 7),\n",
    "-  There is one student who needs to sit exams 0 and 3 (because $X_{0,3}=1$),\n",
    "-  There are six students who need to sit exams 0 and 7 (because $X_{0,7}=6$),\n",
    "-  Nine students are sitting exam 0 (because $X_{0,0}=9$), and so on.\n",
    "  \n",
    "In this matrix, zeros indicate that no students need to sit the two corresponding exams. This means that the pair of exams can be assigned to the same timeslot, and no students will be inconvenienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "A college administrator has been put in charge of creating this year's timetable, which involves $n=139$ exams. The full details of this problem are given to her in the file [timetable.txt](https://github.com/Rhyd-Lewis/GCol/blob/main/docs/casestudy/timetable.txt), which contains an $n \\times n$ symmetrical matrix as described above. She quickly realizes that this problem is too large to solve by hand but can be handled using graph coloring techniques, using nodes for exams and colors for timeslots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## An Initial Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, our administrator reads the file [timetable.txt](https://github.com/Rhyd-Lewis/GCol/blob/main/docs/casestudy/timetable.txt) into a matrix $X$ and creates an $n$-node graph where each node corresponds to an exam. Nodes in this graph are then made adjacent whenever the corresponding pair of exams has a common student. That is, nodes $v_i$ and $v_j$ are made adjacent if and only if $X_{ij}>0$ and $i\\neq j$. Having done this, the administrator determines the chromatic number of this graph. This corresponds to the minimum number of timeslots that are needed to construct a clash-free timetable."
