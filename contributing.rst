============

Contributions from anyone are always welcome! This may include opening `issues <https://github.com/Rhyd-Lewis/GCol/issues>`_, communicating ideas for new features, letting us know about use cases of the library, and code contributions. We would love to receive your pull requests. Here's a handy guide:

First, fork, then clone the repo::

    git clone git@github.com:your-username/GCol.git

Install a development version of the library::

    python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

Make sure the tests pass::

    python pytest tests/test_gcol.py

Add tests for your change. Make your change and make the tests pass. 

Please update the documentation too.

    cd docs
    make html

Push to your fork and submit a pull request!

We look forward to your contributions!
